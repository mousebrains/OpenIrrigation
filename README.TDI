# The communications to the Tucor TDI expanse port is a 9600 baud serial link.
#
# The TDI uses a command/response protocol. The sentence structure is:
#
# SYNC (0x16)
# XX length of remainder of sentence in hex, not including XX or ZZ
# YY...YY sentence  of length XX
# ZZ 1 byte sum of ordinal values of XXYY...YY 
#
# The other end will then acknowledge the sentence was received correctly with an
# ACK (0x06) character
#
# If there is a transmission problem it will send a NAK (0x15) character
#
# If the sentence length and checksum are correct but the sentence content is invalid,
# improper command, invalid number of arguments, out of range arguments, .. a
# Z repsonse is sent.
#
# Sentences are:
# --- Curent and voltage information
# 0U -- Request 
# 1UVVVVCCCC -- Reply, 
#   VVVV is voltage*10 in hex, 
#   CCCC is mAmps in hex

#
# -- Sensors
# 0SXX -- Request information for sensor XX in hex
# 1SXXYYZZZZ -- Reply, 
#   XX sensor, 
#   YY state, 
#   ZZZZ is frequency * 10
#
#           XX 00 -> flow sensor 1
